# Apple Pie

### About the game
This is a small mobile game in which you have to guess one of the words by letter (in the basic version it is a list of American states). With every wrong answer, apples disappear from the tree. You can change the list of predicted words in the structure <a href="https://github.com/lgreydev/ApplePie/blob/main/ApplePie/ListOfWords.swift" rel="ListOfWords" target="_blank">ListOfWords</a>. Words are taken from the list in random order.

### Attention!
If you are using your own list of predicted words, do not use divisions and spaces.

### Rules of the game
You have to guess the hidden word by letter, if you are wrong, then you lose one apple. If you guess the letter, the apples stay in place. For guessing the word you will get a winning point, for losing all apples, you get a losing point. After receiving a win or loss point, the game starts over.
